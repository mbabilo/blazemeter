The note:
If the test application does not work, or the request GET / localhost: 8080 returns 404 code, try changing the port of the test application.

howTo:
1) open \testApp\config.json file
2) change "port": 8080, to "port": 5000, - this is a 2nd line. (you can use any available port for this)
3) start app using: npm start by command line
